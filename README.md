## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **GUI Framework:** Tkinter (`ttk` for themed widgets)
* **Database:** SQLite 3 (for local data storage)
* **Standard Libraries:**
    * `csv` (for CSV export functionality)
    * `datetime` (for date handling)
    * `messagebox` (from Tkinter for alerts and confirmations)
    * `filedialog` (from Tkinter for save file dialog)

## üöÄ Setup and Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3 installed on your system. (Tkinter and SQLite3 are usually included with standard Python installations).

2.  **Clone the repository (Optional, if you're sharing it):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Execute the main Python script (e.g., `expense_tracker.py` or whatever you've named your main file):
    ```bash
    python your_main_script_name.py
    ```
    A `expenses.db` file will be automatically created in the same directory to store your expense data.
